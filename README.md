Battleship: A Modern Take on a Classic Game
Introduction
Battleship, a timeless naval combat game, has captivated players for generations. This project aims to recreate the classic experience in a modern Java environment, combining strategic gameplay with clean code principles.
Key Features
•	Two-player mode: Engage in intense battles against a friend or opponent.
•	Strategic ship placement: Carefully position your ships to maximize their chances of survival.
•	Accurate hit detection: Experience the thrill of a well-placed shot and the disappointment of a miss.
•	Dynamic gameplay: Enjoy the tension and excitement as you navigate the battlefield.
Technologies Used
•	Java: The core language for implementing the game's logic and structure.
•	Object-oriented programming: A modular approach to organize the code and represent game entities.
•	Data structures: Arrays and lists are used to manage game data efficiently.
•	Input/output: The Scanner class is employed for user input, and the console is used for output.
Code Structure and Design
•	Clear separation of concerns: The code is divided into well-defined classes (e.g., Ship, Coordinate, GameField, Player, Game) to improve readability and maintainability.
•	Object-oriented principles: Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are used to create a flexible and extensible design.
•	Clean code practices: Adherence to coding conventions and best practices ensures code quality and maintainability.
Challenges and Solutions
•	Input validation: Implementing robust input validation to prevent errors and ensure a smooth user experience.
•	Hit detection: Developing an accurate algorithm to determine whether a shot has hit a ship.
•	Game flow management: Managing player turns, ship placement, and win conditions effectively.
